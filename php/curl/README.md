# API4AI fashion sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI Fashion API.
The sample is implemented in `PHP` using [cURL](https://www.php.net/manual/ru/book.curl.php) extension.


## Overview

This Fashion API analyzes a picture and gives a list of possible clothes and accessories that could be present on that picture along with their probabilities.


## Getting started

*PHP version `7.x` or greater and `php-curl` extension is required to run this script.*

Try sample with default args:

```bash
php index.php
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
php index.php image.jpg
```
