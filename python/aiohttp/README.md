# API4AI Fashion sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI Fashion API.
The sample is implemented in `python` using [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) module.


## Overview

This Fashion API analyzes a picture and gives a list of possible clothes and accessories that could be present on that picture along with their probabilities.


## Getting started

Preinstall dependencies before use:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Try sample with default args:

```bash
python3 sample.py
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
python3 sample.py image.jpg
```


## About API keys

Demo endpoint is rate limited and should not be used in real projects.
